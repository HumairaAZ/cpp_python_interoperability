# C++ and Python Interoperability using pybind11

## Description
This project demonstrates how to bridge C++ and Python using pybind11. It includes a simple function that adds two numbers and exposes it to Python.

## Setup
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp_python_interoperability.git
    cd cpp_python_interoperability
    ```

2. Build the project:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

3. Test the Python module:
    ```bash
    python3 ../test.py
    ```

## Expected Output
